# CS465-Full_Stack1
# Architecture:
This fullstack application required us to use Express HTML for server-rendered HTML pages, JavaScript was utilize to make those pages interactive, and a single page application (SPA) was used for dynamic content. The SPAs provides a smooth and seamless user expericence with its ability to update content without the page reloading. Javascript was utilized for the API server controllers. The controllers were responsible for rendering the information for a simple web application. Angular was utilized to design a single page application for the admins. This enabled me to develop CRUD functionality so the admin can add, edit, and delete trips from the trips database. We also implemented authentication security on the single page application by using a login function. This was provided to allow on registered users alter the trips. 

# Functionality:
This project used JSON to manage the data for the simple web application. When rendering data to be viewed through the server Javascript is utilized also. Javascript is used in developing API functionality for the application. JSON data file was used before but we relocated them to the API could gain quicker access. JSON does assist in the organizing of data for the application and its presence allows the data not to be in html files hardcoded.

# Testing
We test the application using Postman. Postman lets us utilize the url with similar endpoints for testing. Postman was an important tool to use because it provied us with assurance that the functions were properly secured on the backend.

# Reflction 
This class has taught me alot and has me eager to learn more. This was my first time creating a web application and while it was very challenging it push me to levels I didn't know exist in me. I had to bring my best self in order to successfully complete the project. With no experience in full stack development using the techologies such as Express HTML, Angular, and Node.js I did ok on the project and with the knowledge gain from this experience I'm looking to build off of that momentum and keep getting better as a programmer.
